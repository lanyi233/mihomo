// ErrRebuildRequired reports a difference this inbound will not take in place.
// The listener maps it to "not handled" rather than to a failure, so the caller
// rebuilds exactly as it would have without an Update at all -- no error is
// logged, because nothing went wrong.
//
// It exists so the reasons a change needs a rebuild can live here, next to the
// data planes that impose them, rather than in the option layer which cannot
// see which planes are running.

//
// The caller has already established that the difference is confined to the
// fields handled here -- see the EBPF listener's Update, which compares the two
// options with exactly these fields cleared -- so anything else this reads is
// the same in both. That split is deliberate: the raw option struct is the only
// place a field added later can be caught, and the reasons a field can or
// cannot be applied in place live down here with the data planes.
//
// Every write is reversible and they are applied as one transaction, so a
// failure leaves the inbound coherent on its previous config rather than half
// on each. The caller still falls back to a rebuild, but it may not get one:
// Listen can fail too, and an inbound that is going to keep running until the
// next reload should not be running on a configuration that never existed.
