// This file is the operator-visible outlet of the kernel's degradation
// counters. Three maps already count them -- tc.bpf.c's tc_stats,
// shared_network.bpf.c's shared_stats, fakeip_icmp.bpf.c's fakeip_icmp_stats --
// and until now nothing put any of them in front of a human on a cadence:
// shared_stats was read only to decide when the flow janitor should sweep
// harder, and the other two were read only by tests. docs/internals.md says
// what that costs, in the fork's own words: these degradation paths all "work,
// just without headroom", and from outside they look identical to a healthy
// datapath. That is why the 断流 bug took as long as it did to find.
//
// Three properties keep the report honest. Each is a bug that was found by
// writing the naive version first, not a preference:
//
//   - It reports the DELTA since the previous line, never the lifetime total.
//     A total only ever climbs for as long as a backend lives, so a report keyed
//     on "counter > 0" becomes permanently true after a single event ever
//     observed and re-alerts forever, presenting a historical count as pressure
//     happening now. A threshold compared against the lifetime total is the same
//     bug wearing a bigger number.
//   - It emits ONLY when something moved. Rule one alone is not enough: a
//     datapath that never recovers would otherwise cost a line every tick for
//     as long as the process runs, which is how a real signal gets trained out
//     of an operator. A condition that stops, stops being reported.
//   - It escalates past a per-interval threshold. A handful of events is a race
//     with a reload or a listener restart and belongs at info; a rate that
//     cannot be a race is a condition, and belongs at warning.

const (
	// datapathReportInterval paces the report. The counters describe conditions
	// that last as long as the flows they affect, so a fast cadence would just
	// trade a per-event log for a per-tick one; 30s keeps a burst's magnitude
	// visible while capping a permanently degraded datapath at 120 lines/hour.
	// It is also the denominator of every delta printed, so it has to be fixed:
	// see startDatapathReporter for why this is a ticker of its own rather than
	// a hook on an existing loop.

	// about three times before giving up, a UDP client re-sends a few datagrams,
	// a listener restart affects the flows in flight during the restart. None of
	// them can hold 3.3/s across a whole interval, so above this the datapath is
